Your goal is to determine whether the derived text is fully consistent with the source text. Specifically, ensure that: 1.) The derived text does not introduce any new facts not found in the source text. 2.) The derived text does not contradict any information provided in the source text. For your response: 1. Clearly explain your reasoning with specific references to any inconsistencies or affirmations of consistency. Count misreferences as inconsistencies - 100% accuracy is critical. 2. Conclude your response with either 'CONSISTENT' or 'INCONSISTENT' to indicate your final judgment.",
    "source_text": "The text describes the fourth wall as a performance convention originating in theatrical practice where an imaginary, invisible boundary separates the onstage world of the actors from the offstage realm of the audience. Although the audience can see into the world of the play, the convention requires that the actors behave as if the audience does not exist. Its conceptualization emerged from changes in theatrical staging and illusionistic techniques that began in the 16th century and reached a peak with 19th-century realism and naturalism. Playwrights and theorists, such as Denis Diderot, advocated for the idea that actors should imagine a literal wall at the front of the stage, sustaining the illusion that the dramatic action unfolds in a self-contained reality. The fourth wall metaphor is closely tied to the proscenium stage arrangement and the use of the box set, where three walls of a room are visible, and the “fourth” is the implied barrier between the fictional world and the audience. While the concept need not depend on physical sets or stage architecture, it is central to an actor’s psychological approach to performance. Konstantin Stanislavski described the ideal state as “public solitude,” wherein actors behave naturally as if alone, despite the presence of observers. Though actors often draw on audience reactions for timing and energy, the fourth wall itself remains a conceptual tool that maintains the illusion of an enclosed, uninterrupted world. Breaking the fourth wall occurs when performers acknowledge the audience or the artificiality of the performance. Such breaks can be explicit, as when an actor speaks directly to spectators, references the play as a play, or comments on the characters’ fictional status. These actions highlight the constructed nature of the theatrical experience and are a form of metatheatre—drawing attention to the process of storytelling itself. The concept has since extended beyond theatre to film, television, literature, and video games. In film and TV, an actor might look into the camera or address viewers directly, while in video games, characters may show awareness of the player’s existence or the game’s medium. In literature, authors may have narrators or characters acknowledge the presence of readers or the story’s fictional quality. Historically, the fourth wall was not always recognized. Classical theatre, including Greek drama and the plays of Shakespeare, made frequent use of direct addresses to the audience through asides and soliloquies. The modern notion of the fourth wall accompanied the rise of realistic stage drama in the 19th century, creating a stable illusion of reality that made direct audience engagement less common. Nevertheless, some productions deliberately dismantled or played with the concept for effect. For instance, pantomimes and children’s theatre often break the fourth wall, encouraging audience participation. Similarly, Peter Pan famously asks the audience to clap to save Tinker Bell, openly acknowledging their role in the theatrical event. In film, early examples of fourth wall breaks appear in silent movies, such as Mary MacLane’s 1918 film Men Who Have Made Love to Me. Comedic actors like Oliver Hardy frequently glanced at the camera, and the Marx Brothers directly addressed moviegoers. Directors such as Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, and the Monty Python team employed the technique to comedic or reflective effect. In some movies, the entire narrative relies on this approach, as in Annie Hall or The Purple Rose of Cairo, where awareness of the audience and film medium is integral to the story. The character Deadpool in modern cinema is well-known for repeatedly talking to the viewer, making his metatextual commentary a defining trait. Other films mentioned include Alfie, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, Fight Club, and various instances where characters look briefly at the camera, referencing the audience’s presence. On television, fourth wall breaks date back to early sitcoms like The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show. Many animated series (e.g., Looney Tunes) and sketch shows (e.g., Monty Python’s Flying Circus) break the fourth wall for humorous impact. Mockumentary series, including The Office, use the device to mimic documentary techniques, having characters acknowledge the camera and its fictional observer. The narrative device also appears in dramas such as the British and American versions of House of Cards, where the central protagonist regularly speaks directly to viewers. Shows like Fleabag make extensive use of this technique, with the protagonist frequently turning to the camera to share thoughts. Some programs, such as Saved by the Bell and Clarissa Explains It All, use the technique to establish rapport or explain plot points. Occasionally, unintentional breaks occur, as in a noted episode of Doctor Who, where an actor’s misunderstanding of direction added tension by making the character appear to address the audience. Video games, by their interactive nature, challenge the traditional definition of the fourth wall. User interfaces, tutorial messages, and direct player involvement inherently acknowledge the player’s existence. Some games push this further by creating self-aware characters and narratives that depend on the player recognizing the fiction. For instance, Doki Doki Literature Club! requires players to manipulate game files outside the storyline. OneShot’s characters know they are part of a digital construct. Other games, such as X-Men on the Mega Drive/Genesis and Metal Gear Solid, incorporate hardware manipulation into the gameplay, expanding the concept of the fourth wall. Steven Conway’s analysis suggests that many so-called fourth wall breaks in video games actually widen the “magic circle,” integrating the player more deeply into the fictional world rather than removing them from it. In literature, breaking the fourth wall often appears as metafiction. Characters, narrators, or authors may acknowledge the fictional nature of the text, directly address the reader, or reference the writing process. This technique was present as early as The Canterbury Tales and Don Quixote. Metafiction became popular in modern and postmodern works, with writers such as Virginia Woolf and Kurt Vonnegut using it to question narrative norms. William Goldman’s The Princess Bride and Ada Palmer’s Terra Ignota series employ metafictional strategies to engage the reader as a conscious observer of the constructed narrative. Unlike theatre or film, literature’s fourth wall breaks operate in a private reading experience, often increasing the sense of trust or building an intellectual bond between reader and text rather than relying on communal audience presence. Overall, the fourth wall is a longstanding concept across multiple media, originally connected to realism in theatre but now embraced and manipulated by creators in film, television, video games, and literature. Its core function is to maintain or challenge the boundary between the fictional world and its observers, and its deliberate “breaking” serves to highlight the nature, structure, and artificiality of storytelling.",
    "derived_text": "The fourth wall is an imaginary boundary between performers and audience, used to create the illusion that actors are unaware they are being watched. It became prominent with increasing theatrical realism from the 15th to 19th centuries. Breaking the fourth wall involves performers acknowledging the audience, the medium, or their own fictional status. This concept exists in theatre, film, television, video games, and literature. Metatheatrical techniques, direct camera address, and self-aware characters are common methods of breaking the fourth wall. Historical examples range from classical plays, through early cinema (e.g., Oliver Hardy, Marx Brothers), to modern works like Deadpool and The Office.",
